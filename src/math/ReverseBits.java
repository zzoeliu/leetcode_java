 * Reverse bits of a given 32 bits unsigned integer.

 For example, given input 43261596 (represented in binary as 00000010100101000001111010011100), return 964176192 (represented in binary as 00111001011110000010100101000000).

 Follow up:
 If this function is called many times, how would you optimize it?

 Note:
 how to get the bit from 0 to 1 or 1 to 0?
 just use bit ^ 1;
