  3.Design issues
    For Roman numbers:

    counting numbersï¼š
    Consecutive numbers of the same number. We need to add up these same numbers to get our result.
    Smaller number on right side of bigger number. we need to add them to get our result.VIII = 8
    smaller number(I,X,C) on left side of larger number, we need to subtract small number from larger
    number to get our result.IV = 4
    same number will not be consecutive more than 3 times.
    a line on the number means 1000 times the original one(exclude from this problem, cause we just consider 1..3999)


    How to calculate(1..3999)
    traverse the roman, if the former is smaller, we need to add , othereise, we need to add this number and substract
    2 times the former one.

  4.Coding&debugging issues
       switch()
       {
            case 1 : ; break;
            case 2 : ; break;
            ..
            default: ;

       }

  6.Rules
    Java naming rules
    http://www.cnblogs.com/doit8791/archive/2012/05/24/2517233.html
        packages use lower case
        classes initiates with capital letters for each word, the same as interface
        methods use lower case
        variables initiates with lower case but capital letters as the initial letter for following words
        const use capital letters for all words
